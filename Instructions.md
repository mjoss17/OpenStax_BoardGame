# OpenStax Refactoring Exercise

## Overview

Welcome to the Refactoring Exercise! You are very close to the final phase of the interviewing process. 

We ask that you read the instructions in full before beginning the assignment. The importance of the assignment is 
that you are able to demonstrate clearly your technical excellence. No frameworks or other dependencies are required,
but if you wish to include libraries that will help that is fine. The choice of development environment is up to you.
You should plan on spending several hours on the assignment and committing your changes as you work. The total time is
up to you but we do expect the exercise to be turned in within a couple days.

Review the code closely and think about how you would improve the code. There is no ONE right answer to the exercise.
When refactoring this code think about how you can include tests to reduce the risks of your changes. We are VERY
interested in how you would write tests to help you refactor this code. Feel free to take notes along the way.

If you run out of time, focus on your overall implementation and stub out whatever classes and methods you have left.
Place comments/docstrings, where necessary, and explain how they should work. Once you feel you have completed the 
assignment send the url of the GitHub repository for further review.

The code does not have to run! We'll assume that the time will exist to work out bugs and make it eventually run.

We will review your code and let you know the next steps. Be prepared to explain your decisions.

## Instructions 

This assignment requires you to create a GitHub repository (and account if you don't have one) and committing your 
changes as you work through the assignment. You can commit whenever you feel it is necessary. Our advice is that 
you "commit early and often." We're interested in your process of working through this problem (aka sausage making).

1. Create a repository on GitHub with the `refactoring_exercise.py` file below as an initial commit. You can name the
repository however you like.
2. Start coding!
3. Commit along the way until you are happy with the result.
5. Send the URL of your GitHub to who sent you here =).
6. ?
7. PROFIT
